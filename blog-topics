Streaming responses from the compojure API

Getting simple on the request / (wirting a macro to just define what I want)
 -- wanted to keep things testable.  Can't do full DI (databases, and such).
    but wanted to avoid as much as possible "magic" dynamic vars.  Bleck!
    Decided to pass the req into the layouts, views, everywhere. and pull data from that
    as needed.

With - required - params MACRO explanation

Layouts of the website - layouts, etc.

Paths and routes... Best of most worlds. :P
  -- i use the paths , and in routes, I just pass in the ":hive-uuid".
      Simple. And the mappings are obvious and visible.

Defining a 404 page which dpeends on the request
(ANY "*" {:as req} (system/not-found req))
